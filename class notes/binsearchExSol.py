# Binary search - SOLUTION of binsearchEx.py

# This version is made to fit the search interface
# used in insertionExercise.py.
# The best way to do insertion sort is to use the insertV2
# function, with binary search instead of linear search.

#######################################################
# Search a sorted list segment.
# The idea is to use two variables, j and hi,
# narrowing the search range with j on the low
# side and hi on the high side.
# with invariant L[0:j] <= x and x < L[hi:i] and j<=hi
# Each iteration should decrease hi - j .
# 
# Note: as in the lab exercise on sorting, the notation
# L[0:j] <= x means all elements of L[0:j] are at most x.
# This isn't Python, it's just notation used in comments.
